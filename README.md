# Nexus: AIS club data sharing

A while ago I was working on the strategy doc for our group. **I had a few questions that could be answered by data which other groups may have, but we do not** because we are a younger org. Examples:

- what is the conversion rate for people who do some sort of returning fellows / paper reading group program to get into other fellowships eg SPAR?
- What is the completes SPAR → goes on to become FTE in AIS conversion rate?
- What factors (ex major, stated value alignment) are correlated with {insert thing we want ex not dropping out of an intro fellowship}

This gave me an idea:

## **Cross-club data sharing portal**

Clubs could make their data accessible to other clubs. Potentially put the shared data into a simple portal for organizers, where an organizer could ask a question and get an answer quickly from an AI agent that has access to the datasets, has a runtime environment to run analyses and returns a short report with results (also make the raw data available to others).

### Example:

**Organizer**: {goes to portal} 

“% of people who have completed two or more AI safety fellowships that go on to become full-time in AI safety?”

**Agent**: {Runs analysis} {presents clean report}

Potential big issue:
I don't know how many clubs have good data for this to be built on - this is also an opportunity. If we made a guide on what data to collect and how to collect it s.t. it was reasonably easy to get started, I think a lot of clubs would collect the data and thus have much better visibility into the effects of their programming? (Pathfinder could potentially mandate / strongly encourage this + have people use tools that let the data easily sync to a shared portal?) Idea: create and share template Airtable bases and forms.

## Extension: also create a central repo of club’s Notion / Google Docs

Put an agent on top

**User:** find me all the intro fellowship curriculums anyone uses

**Agent:** Finds them, presents links + recommendation + summary

**Structure**

- Add an upvote system for everyone
- Strong curation system from trusted subset of people who can designate "this is best"
- AI interface

## **Sustainability** (this applies to both projects)

- Open source
- Docs
- Co-maintainers
    - 1+ less commitment-filled co-maintainers who you delegate tasks to with the intention: "I'm going to run this for three months then it's yours"
- KISS
- Catchy name
